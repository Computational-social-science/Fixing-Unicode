    Once there was a little o,
    with an accent on top like só.

    It started out as UTF8,
    (universal since '98),
    but the program only knew latin1,
    and changed little ó to "Ã³" for fun.

    A second program saw the "Ã³"
    and said "I know HTML entity!"
    So "Ã³" was smartened to "&ATILDE;&SUP3;"
    and passed on through happily.

    Another program saw the tangle
    (more precisely, ampersands to mangle)
    and thus the humble "&ATILDE;&SUP3;"
    became "&AMP;AMP;ATILDE;&AMP;AMP;SUP3;"
